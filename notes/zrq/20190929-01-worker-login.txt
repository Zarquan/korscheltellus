    # Solution to the SSH config problem.
    # On our desktop or laptop we are a normal users.
    # Inside the ansible-client Docker container we are root, or a UID fixed from insde the container.
    #
    # We need to use the esperia gateway as a ssh proxy node to get from our desktop/laptop to one of the worker nodes.
    # We want to use a personal account on the esperia gateway rather than a common shared account or root.
    # Only we know the name of our personal account, so it should not be in the checked in code (which is is at the moment).
    # Best place is to put it in our personal ssh config, on our desktop/laptop.
    #
    # Ideally we need to use the ssh config from our desktop/laptop inside the ansible-client container.
    # Obvious way is to mount our ~/.ssh/config file inside the container as a volume.
    # However, a volume mount doesn't change the ownership of the file, so the ~/.ssh/config inside the container is still owned by our uid from outside.
    # So when we run the ssh client, as root, the client refuses to use a ~/.ssh/config file with the wrong ownership.
    # Even if we are root.
    #

    #
    # Solution #1 - Copy the ssh config file from our laptop rather that trying mount it directly.
